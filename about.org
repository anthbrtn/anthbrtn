I’m currently based in Toronto, Canada.
I’m a master’s student at Ryerson and York University’s Joint Program in Communication & Culture, where
I study digital methods and political subcultures online. In the fall, I’ll be joining the Digital
Democracies Lab at the University of Simon Fraser on a SSHRC Joseph Bombardier Scholarship.
I’m the co-founder of the [[https://www.dcc.infoscapelab.ca][Digital Citizenship Cultures Initiative]]. I’m also a part of the OI Lab
(which, if you know of it, will understand why I’m not linking) at the University of
Amsterdam. I used to work for the [[https://reviewcanada.ca][Literary Review of Canada]], where I helped make our annual
Spur Festival of ideas.
