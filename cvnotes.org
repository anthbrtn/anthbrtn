* Notes
  Anything that I apply to, even, add to CV.
Awards and honours are individual, while external research grants are a separate
direction.
Anything you organize, do that in “conferences, workshops, roundtables” that you
organized. That shows that you get along with people, that you’re nice, etc.

Teaching assistantships: put number of students, or put “lecture, large seminar,
etc”.
Also put the nomination for the TAGA of the year award.

Sectioning for teaching: courses taught, teaching assistantships, guest lectures

Last category: university service. GSA work, for example. General idea of
sectioning is research, practice, grants
